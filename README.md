# Data Analytics of Energy Production, Emissions and Economic Activities

## PROJECT PURPOSE
The purpose of this project is to analyze the relationship between energy production, greenhouse gas emissions and business activities in Turkey using data from TÜİK and TEİAŞ. By visualizing key trends in electricity generation, company distribution and emission levels through Power BI, the study aims to highlight how economic growth and energy mix influence environmental impact over time.

## DASHBOARD 1 - KEY ECONOMIC INDICATORS BY ACTIVITY AND YEAR

First dashboard provides an analytical overview of company dynamics and employment distribution across different economic activities between 2009 and 2024.

- The slicer allows users to filter the entire dashboard by economic activity, making it easier to focus on specific sectors such as construction, manufacturing, or education.  
- The line chart titled **“Change in Total Number of Companies by Year”** illustrates how the number of companies has evolved over time by size category (large, medium, small, and micro).  
  A notable increase in micro-sized companies after 2017 is observed, which is likely due to KOSGEB supports, tax and accounting reforms, and the formalization of previously unregistered micro enterprises.  
- The KPI cards display the current total number of companies by legal type in 2024, including **Limited Liability**, **Joint-stock**, and **Cooperatives**, offering a quick snapshot of business structure distribution.  
- The pie chart shows the **share of total employees by company size in 2024**, highlighting that large and small enterprises employ the majority of the workforce.  
- The combined bar and line chart visualizes the **total number of employees and companies by year**, showing a parallel upward trend that reflects both business expansion and employment growth over time.

## DASHBOARD 2 - ELECTRICITY GENERATION AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OVERVIEW

Second dashboard presents the relationship between electricity generation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions over time.

- The line and column chart **(Electricity Generation and Number of Companies by Year, 2009–2023)** shows a steady increase in total electricity production (GWh) and the number of companies in Turkey, indicating continuous market expansion.  
- The other line and column chart **(Electricity Production vs. CO₂ Emissions, 1990–2023)** highlights a strong correlation between electricity generation and CO₂ emissions, showing that as energy production increases, carbon emissions also rise significantly.  
- The line chart on top **(Sectoral Greenhouse Gas Emissions, 1990–2023)** compares emissions by major sectors. The energy sector clearly dominates total GHG emissions, while agriculture, waste, and industrial processes contribute at relatively low levels.  
- The line chart on bottom **(Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Type, 1990–2023)** illustrates that **carbon dioxide (CO₂)** is the primary contributor to total emissions, followed by **methane (CH₄)** and **nitrous oxide (N₂O)**, while F-gases remain minimal.

## DASHBOARD 3 - ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION BY ENERGY SOURCE AND RELATED EMISSIONS

- The line and column chart **‘Coal-Based Electricity Generation and Energy Sector Emissions (1990–2023)’**:  
  Electricity generation from coal shows a clear upward trend, especially between 2005 and 2015, when both production and emissions rose in parallel.  
  As coal is a carbon-intensive energy source, the increase in generation directly led to higher greenhouse gas emissions.  
  Although coal-based generation slightly declined after 2020, emission levels remained high — indicating the long-lasting environmental impact of coal use.  
  This chart highlights how coal continues to play a dominant yet environmentally costly role in electricity production.  

- The line and column chart **‘Hydropower Generation and Energy Sector Emissions (1990–2023)’**:  
  Hydropower generation exhibits a fluctuating trend, which is natural given its dependence on water availability and seasonal conditions.  
  Despite the variations in generation, emissions have remained relatively stable and low.  
  Even as hydropower production increased after 2010, the corresponding rise in emissions was minimal — reflecting the environmentally friendly nature of this renewable source.  
  This chart demonstrates that hydropower contributes positively to sustainable energy production with limited environmental impact.  

- The line and column chart **‘Renewable Energy and Waste-Based Electricity Generation and Energy Sector Emissions (1990–2023)’**:  
  Since the early 2000s, renewable and waste-based electricity generation has grown sharply, marking a significant shift in the energy mix.  
  Despite this strong increase in production, emissions did not show a steep rise.  
  As the share of renewable sources expanded, the overall rate of emission growth slowed — clearly demonstrating the positive effect of the ongoing energy transition.  
  This chart emphasizes the critical role of renewables in achieving sustainable, low-carbon electricity generation.  

- The line and column chart **‘Natural Gas-Based Electricity Generation and Energy Sector Emissions (1990–2023)’**:  
  Natural gas-based electricity generation increased substantially from 1990 to 2014.  
  Emissions also rose during this period but at a slower pace compared to coal, as natural gas has a lower carbon intensity.  
  After 2020, production and emissions show a moderate decline, possibly due to energy diversification, price effects, or the shift toward renewables.  
  This chart reflects natural gas’s transitional role — cleaner than coal but still a notable contributor to total emissions.
